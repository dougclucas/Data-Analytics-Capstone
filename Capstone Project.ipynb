    "    Coronavirus or Covid-19 emerged in late 2019 and has quickly spread around the globe.  It is a virus that usually causes flu-like symptoms but can cause more advanced complications for patients that have preexisting conditions or potentially even be fatal.  The World Health Organization classified the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency on January 30th, 2020.  It was later upgraded to a Global Pandemic on March 11th.\n",
    "    Due to the rapid spread of the virus, many healthcare facilities have become overrun with patients requiring intensive care.  To be able to handle the wave of patients requiring ICU beds, temporary hospitals or healthcare facilities have been assembled in cities with large outbreaks.  Evidence also suggests that communities with a lack of access to testing and healthcare facilities are more severely affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.  "
